        "Focus while typing helps you minimize errors. It's better to type slow and accurate than to rush and make mistakes that cost time to correct.",
        "Accuracy is your foundation. Once you build a habit of hitting the right keys consistently, speed will come naturally without effort.",
        "A steady rhythm is the key to fluent typing. Avoid sudden bursts or pauses. Let your fingers flow like you're playing a musical instrument.",
